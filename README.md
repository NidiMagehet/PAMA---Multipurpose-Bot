# PAMA---Multipurpose-Bot
PAMA is a multifunctional bot which can be sufficient for all your needs, a simple way to getting introduced to *her* is by trying some of her commands on your bot.
Her code structure was inspired by The Enmap and the better-sqlite-tool libraries, note that i didn't change any of the code i got spoon-fed by an already existing repository, aka AnIdiotsGuide
You may as well follow their steps before proceeding to the special modifications i have made.
